## Fundamental Rules
1. We shan't ever violate or modify these three rules.
2. We are a progressive group and should act in alignment with that.
   - That is, we should strive not to perpetuate bigotry, exploitation, or
     injustice, and should in fact try to reduce those things.
3. Any decision (that doesn't go against these rules, of course) can be made by
   the consent of at least 95% of our members.
   - We can and should still create more efficient systems in addition to this.

TODO: consider criteria for whose consent should be absolutely required
(to prevent hostile takeovers and stalling from being technically allowed)
