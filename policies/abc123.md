## Fundamental Rules
1. We shan't ever violate or modify these three rules.

     TODO: possibly clarify specific positions

   the consent of at least 80% of members who fit the following criteria:
   1. TODO: Consider the criteria for whose consent should be absolutely
      required. I think this is important so we can prevent stalling, both
      intentional and unintentional, as well as hostile takeovers, while still
      having things be reasonably fair.
   - We can and should still create more efficient systems in addition to this.
   - This decision-making process overrules all others.
