# Content Rules
*draft, consent not yet acquired*

## AI Usage
1. Do not use AI-generated content or assets, except to comment on said content.
   - However, it's okay to use an LLM for inspiration or feedback,
     as long as the output is evaluated and implemented by real people.

## Licensing & Attribution
1. Prefer to use copyleft, libre, and public-domain assets.
   - [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org) is one good place to
     find them. It's run by the same organization as Wikipedia and allows you to
     search by media type, license, and keywords.
2. Always credit creators, unless either:
   1. They asked you not to.
   2. They're definitely problematic
      and the license doesn't require attribution.
3. Our content should be released under appropriate copyleft or public-domain
   licenses unless there is some practical reason not to use such a license.
   - Typically, we should use CC-BY-SA 4.0.

## Quality Guidelines
1. TODO: topics
2. Try to be very correct and rational.
   - Do all necessary research and/or testing.
   - Don't lie, even by omission.
3. Present the information in a way that people will actually stick around for.
   - Be clear and reasonably concise.
   - Try not to be boring!
   - Make sure your sound and visuals are decent!
     - ...*especially* sound.
