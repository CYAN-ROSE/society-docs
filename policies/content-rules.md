# Content Rules
*draft, consent not yet acquired*

## AI Usage
1. Do not use AI-generated content or assets, except to comment on said content.
   - However, it's okay to use an LLM for inspiration or feedback,
     as long as the output is evaluated and implemented by real people.

## Licensing & Attribution
1. Prefer to use copyleft, libre, and public-domain assets.
2. Always credit creators, unless either:
   - They asked you not to.
   - They're definitely problematic and the license doesn't require attribution.
3. Our content should be released under appropriate copyleft or public-domain
   licenses unless there is some practical reason not to use such a license.

## Quality Guidelines
1. TODO: on topics
2. TODO: on presentation and aesthetic quality
3. TODO: on conciseness, clarity, and thoroughness
