# Society of the Cyan Rose Docs

This is the internal documentation for the politically progressive content
creation group *Society of the Cyan Rose*.
It's public on GitHub to keep us accountable and stuff!

We try to give people info they can reasonably apply in their lives for the
better, rather than just covering more theoretical or out-of-reach topics.
