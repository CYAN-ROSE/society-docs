# The Society of the Cyan Rose

These are the internal-ish documents for the politically progressive content
creation group *Society of the Cyan Rose*, including our internal policies,
goals, and maybe other things at some point.

## Mission Statement

TODO: rewrite to be more concise, easier to understand for people who are not
already familiar with what I'm talking about, and possibly more correct

A lot of online progressive content covers subjects
that are very hard for ordinary people to do much about.

For the activities of politicians and their goons,
a person can vote, protest, and lobby,
but opportunities to do those things are relatively infrequent,
not everyone can do them safely or at all,
and it's unlikely that you will make significant systemic and cultural change
through political institutions.

It's *absolutely* important to do those things and to be informed,
but they aren't sufficient alone,
especially when so much is really controlled
by mostly-unaccountable businesspeople.
Listening to depressing news that they can't do much about
will mostly just make a person depressed.

We're here to help convince more people to care about specific causes
and, importantly, *help them take direct action*.

To accomplish that, we create and distribute media to inform and advise people
about causes we find important.
